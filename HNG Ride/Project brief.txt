Introduction to Data Analytics:
Objective
This task introduces you to the data analytics workflow.
You will find a dataset, explore and clean it, answer meaningful questions, and present your findings 
	clearly and professionally using Excel only.

Task Instructions
Step 1: Find a Dataset    
•    Choose a Sales, Marketing, or Business-related dataset you can share publicly.
•    Use open sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, World Bank, or government open data portals.
•    Optionally, you may combine datasets (ensure they can be merged by a common column like Date, Country, or Customer ID).

Step 2: Explore Your Data    
•    Understand your dataset’s structure (columns, data types, missing values).
•    Identify and fix:
    ◦    Missing or inconsistent data
    ◦    Outliers
    ◦    Typographical errors
•    Summarize your findings briefly.

Step 3: Define 1–3 Research Questions
	Your questions should be:
    •    Clear and answerable with your dataset.
    •    Interesting and relevant to business or policy decisions.

 Examples:
    •    “How does customer discount affect total sales revenue?”
    •    “Which region generated the highest sales in Q1?”
    •    “Is there a relationship between marketing spend and product returns?”

Step 4: Document Your Dataset and Questions

    •    Write down:    ◦    Dataset name and source link.
    ◦    Number of rows/columns.
    ◦    Key variables (features).
    ◦    Your research question(s).

Step 5: Choose Your Analysis Methods

    •    Decide how you will answer your questions using Excel tools:
    ◦    Descriptive → averages, sums, counts, percentages.
    ◦    Comparative → pivot tables, grouped bar charts.
    ◦    Correlation → scatter plots, trendlines.
    ◦    Trend analysis → Revenue over time.

Step 6: Present Your Findings

    •    Summarize your insights using clear charts and tables.
    •    Tell a story:
 What did you find? Why does it matter? What’s your conclusion?Step 7: Identify LimitationsExamples:
    •    Small dataset.
    •    Missing time period.
    •    Biased or incomplete records.


Step 8 (Optional): Suggest Future WorkMention how this project could be improved:
    •    Collect more data.
    •    Use a visualization tool (Power BI, Tableau).
    •    Explore predictive methods later.


Tool Requirement
Use Excel only for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
